        "3. **Breathing**: Remember to breathe deeply and consistently. This helps your body stay oxygenated and perform at its best.",
        "4. **Duration**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of cardio for optimal heart health. Increase the time as your endurance improves.",

        "3. **Balance Postures**: Incorporate balance poses like Tree Pose or Warrior III to enhance stability and strength.",
        "4. **Focus on Flexibility**: Include stretches like Downward Dog, Forward Fold, and Pigeon Pose to target different muscle groups.",

        "3. **Full Body Engagement**: Include exercises that engage your whole body such as mountain climbers, squat jumps, and push-ups.",
        "4. **Pacing**: Maintain a pace that challenges you but doesn't leave you completely exhausted. The idea is to push hard during intervals and rest during the recovery period.",
